    This code has been created for use in Adventure Land streams on the above channel.
    This code will not be modified in any drastic way outside of streams.
    There may be changes such as adding comments, fixing spacing, indentation, etc;
    Total amount of hours streamed: 4h 2m on 22 Feb. 2021.

    If you want more constant updates outside of the official Adventure land Discord,
    consider joining this one: https://discord.gg/dv6xyZEvY9.
    There is a dedicated AL channel where I will discuss and answer questions about
    the code that is being written on the streams.

    I am open to requests to do in depth and easily digestible Youtube videos for AL,
    however there would need to be enough demand to make it worth it.

    If you would like to request to see anything done, or questions answered on a stream,
    please let me know in the discord linked above.

/*
    As an FYI, I try and comment and document this well, but too much bloat-documentation can be a bad thing,
    believe it or not. If something isn't quite clear, try searching the function to see where else
    it might be in the code. It may be that it depends on another custom function, or has some other
    dependency that will make much more sense once you find it.
